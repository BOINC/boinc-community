# BOINC Contributors Call

The *contributors call* is a call organized by the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) Program Management Committed (PMC) that will take place every month. An agenda will be posted in advance and minutes will be posted afterwards.

The call is intended for people who are involved in or are interested in being involved in the software development of the [BOINC software](https://github.com/BOINC/boinc).  The definition of *being involved in the software development* is the definition defined in the BOINC governance document.

It is important to note that this is a call that will focus on the software development work for the BOINC software.  It is not for the purpose of obtaining nor providing technical support.  The goal of the call is to help the development process becomes more effective, and thereby we will be able to more effectively work through bugs and help the end users.

The purpose of the call is to connect the different contributors and coordinate our work in order to improve our ability to develop and improve the software platform.
