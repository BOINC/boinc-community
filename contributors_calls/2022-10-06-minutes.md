## Server Release Update
Started the [release notes](https://github.com/BOINC/boinc/releases/tag/server_release%2F1.3%2F1.3.0)

Went through all the changes (770+) since 01 Sept 2019 and identified ~100 affecting the server.

The version is currenty 1.3 but we may have to bump it to 1.4.
From the [code](https://github.com/BOINC/boinc/blob/master/html/user/server_status.php#L204), it looks like even numbers are release versions.

The labels were very helpful during preperation. Thanks to Vitalii for putting in the effort to keep the tags up to date. 

The release has already been deployed on on LHC@home dev. Will pubulish the release notes when ready. 

## Community Outreach 
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)
BOINC Radio 100s of listeners, discord and twitter.

D-Science: Nonprofit formed - in the US

## Issues/Pull Requests
[Client: error when handling retries of failed downloads](https://github.com/BOINC/boinc/issues/4642)

We should have a small but continous effort to reduce the number PR and issues.
