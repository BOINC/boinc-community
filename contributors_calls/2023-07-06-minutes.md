* Attendees: Vitali, Laurence, David A, Matt

## Welcome
Checkpoint discussion about the meetings after having held them for a year. We will continue them. Matt requested more regular communication on when the meetings will take place.

Discussion on the stats with respect to GDPR. As volunteers have to now opt-in to the stats, some information on participation is now missing/misleading. Einstein@home are investigating. Action: Laurence to compare internal and export stats for the LHC@home project. Discussion on whether or not the Cross Project ID is personal data. This issue could trigger a new server release. 

## Client Release Update
Version [7.22.2](https://github.com/BOINC/boinc/releases/tag/client_release%2F7.22%2F7.22.2) has been released. There is a bug relating to dark mode. Matt asked how the dark mode affected skins. The project is now building installers for Linux and the packages will be available on the BOINC Website. There will be two versions; alpha and stable. Action: Laurence to test the CI Linux packaging.  
 
## Server Release Update
The latest version is running on LHC@home.   

## Issues/Pull Requests
None to discuss. 

## AOB
The next meeting is scheduled for 7th September 19:00 UTC.
